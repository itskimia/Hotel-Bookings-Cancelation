# Hotel-Bookings-Cancelation

In this project, I applied supervised learning on the hotel booking dataset that will find a way to predict the chance of cancellation for a
particular hotel booking record.This is originaly a Kaggle competition which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) and was done as my Final Project for the Data Mining course under supervision of Dr. Ehsan Nazerfard.

As my first step into finding a solution for a datamining problem, I
explored into the dataset which is formally called EDA. I determined
which features of the dataset are more informative. Then I took three methods (Decision Tree, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, and MLP) and
compared their results. I used accuracy as the performance metric and drew the corresponding confusin matrices. 

This code is implemented by python
programming language and its related libraries like Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras,
etc.
